    <ol>
      <li>assign everyone a number</li>
      <li>go around in a circle taking turns asking questions</li>
      <li>when you hit "ask the question", the person assigned to that number answers the question aloud</li>
      <li>but in their heads, everyone secretly answers</li>
      <li>enjoy your soul-search, i hope you find what you're looking for >>>:)</li>
